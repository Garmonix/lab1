## Who am i?

- Yakushevich Artem Urievich

- Since 2018, I have been studying at RUDN University in the specialty Mathematics and Computer Science.

## Why do Lab 7?

- This model allows you to simulate the behavior of advertising distribution with different input data.

- This model is used by experts to competently attract the audience to the product and analyze the growth of users.

- This is a useful skill for any entrepreneur in business. So you can assess the risks and opportunities of your business.

## The purpose of the laboratory work

consider the advertising effectiveness model.

## Laboratory tasks

1. Build a schedule of advertising distribution, the mathematical model of which is described by the following equation:
 $\frac{\text{d}n}{\text{d}t} = (0.62+0.000023n(t))(N-n(t))$.

2. Build a schedule of advertising distribution, the mathematical model of which is described by the following equation:
$\frac{\text{d}n}{\text{d}t} = (0.000024+0.4n(t))(N-n(t))$.

3. Build a schedule of advertising distribution, the mathematical model of which is described by the following equation:
$\frac{\text{d}n}{\text{d}t} = (0.5t+0.5n(t))(N-n(t))$.

4. Determine at what point in time the speed of advertising distribution will have the maximum value.

5. Answer questions for laboratory work.

## Results of the laboratory work

В процессе выполнения лабораторной работы я научилась:

1. Build a schedule of advertising distribution, the mathematical model of which is described by the following equation:
  $\frac{\text{d}n}{\text{d}t} = (0.62+0.000023n(t))(N-n(t))$.

2. Build a schedule of advertising distribution, the mathematical model of which is described by the following equation:
$\frac{\text{d}n}{\text{d}t} = (0.000024+0.4n(t))(N-n(t))$.

3. Build a schedule of advertising distribution, the mathematical model of which is described by the following equation:
$\frac{\text{d}n}{\text{d}t} = (0.5t+0.5n(t))(N-n(t))$.

- to determine at what point in time the speed of advertising distribution will have the maximum value.

## findings

As a result of the seventh laboratory work, I examined the advertising effectiveness model.
