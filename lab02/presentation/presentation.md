# laboratory work 2

## Who is this guy

-Yakushevich Artyom Yurievich student of NKNbd-01-18.

## Why do lab 2?

- Learn to build a mathematical model
- Pursuit tasks have a practical application, so getting to know them cannot be superfluous;


## The purpose of the laboratory work

- Learn to solve the chase problem using the example of building a mathematical model in Python and also interact with the Jupyter project.

## Laboratory tasks:

- 1. Write down the equation describing the movement of the boat, with the initial
conditions for two cases (depending on the location of the boat
relative to the boat at the initial moment of time).
- 2. Build the trajectory of the boat and the boat for two cases.
- 3. Find the point of intersection of the boat and boat trajectory.

## Results of the laboratory work

- I got acquainted with the construction of a mathematical model
- Remembered the Python language
- Learned to admire Jupyter
- Learned to write down the equations describing the movement of the boat, with initial conditions for two cases;
- Build trajectories of the boat and boat for two cases;
- Search and find points of intersection of the trajectory of the boat and the boat.

# Findings

As a result of completing the second laboratory work, I considered one of the examples of constructing mathematical models for choosing the correct strategy when solving search problems and learned how to determine which trajectory the boat needs to move in order to catch up with the boat.
