## Who am I?

- Yakushevich Artem Urevich

- Since 2018, I have been studying at RUDN University in the specialty Mathematics and Computer Science.

## Why do 8?

- The model of competition between two firms makes it possible to simulate the behavior of changes in the working capital of several firms.

- This model is widely used by specialists in the field of economics.

- This is a useful skill for any entrepreneur in business. So you can evaluate the chosen niche and other important parameters.

## Lab 8 aims

Consider a model of competition between two firms.

## Lab 8 tasks

Construct graphs of changes in the working capital of firm 1 and firm 2 without taking into account fixed costs and with the introduced normalization for case 1.

Construct graphs of changes in the working capital of firm 1 and firm 2 without taking into account fixed costs and with the introduced normalization for case 2.

## Lab 8 results

- to build graphs of changes in the circulating assets of firm 1 and firm 2 without taking into account fixed costs and with the introduced normalization for case 1.

- to build graphs of changes in the circulating assets of firm 1 and firm 2 without taking into account fixed costs and with the introduced normalization for case 2.

## findings

As a result of the eighth laboratory work, I examined the model of competition between two firms.
